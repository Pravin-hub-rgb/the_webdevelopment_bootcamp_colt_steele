    <p>The <b>position</b> CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document, The top, right, botton and left
        properties determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>position:static</h3>
    <p>
        The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left and z-index
        properties have <i>no</i> effect. <b>This is the default value.</b>
    </p>
    <section>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>test</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
    </section>
    <hr>
    <h3>position:relative</h3>
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based
        on the values of top, right, botton, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements;
        thus, the space given for
        the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static. <br> Element is moving relative to the
        position where it would be normally.
    </p>
    <section>
        <div></div>
        <div style="position:relative; top: 50px; left:30px;">

    <hr> <br>
    <hr> <br>
    <h3>position:absolute;</h3>
    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
        It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the
        initial containing block.
        It's final position is determined by values of top, right, bottom and left.</p>
    <section style="position: relative;">
        <div></div>
        <div style="position:absolute; top: 50px; left:30px;">

    <hr> <br>
    <h3>position:fixed;</h3>
    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
        It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its
        ancestors has a trnasform,
        perspective, or filter property set to something other than none, in which case that ancestor behaves as the
        containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</p>
    <section>
        <div></div>
        <div style="position:fixed; top: 50px; left:800px; opacity: 0.3;">
            <p>test <br> position:fixed;</p>
        </div>

    </section>
    <hr>
    <h3>position:sticky;</h3>
    <p>something begins not fixed at the top but when we scroll then it get fixed.</p>
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest
        scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements, based
        on the values of top, right,
        bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
